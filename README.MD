# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides all necessary steps to set up and run the SCSS and JavaScript compilation for your project using Gulp. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. This will include npm, which is needed to install packages.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

Once you are in the project directory, install the required Node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

## Modules Explained

Here is a brief overview of each module used in this project:

- **gulp**: The streaming build system that automates painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.
- **gulp-sass**: A plugin for Gulp that compiles SCSS files into CSS.
- **gulp-clean-css**: A plugin to minify CSS files.
- **gulp-sourcemaps**: Provides source map support, which helps in debugging the CSS files by linking the CSS styles back to the original SCSS files.
- **gulp-concat**: Concatenates files, typically used here to merge multiple JavaScript files into a single file.

## Gulp Tasks

### Starting the Compilation

To start the SCSS and JavaScript compilation, run the following command:

```bash
gulp
```

This command runs the default Gulp task defined in `gulpfile.js`, which includes compiling SCSS to CSS, merging JavaScript files, and initiating the watch task.

### Watch Command

The watch task monitors changes in your SCSS and JavaScript source files. Whenever a change is detected, Gulp will automatically recompile the SCSS or merge JavaScript files depending on which file was changed. This is initiated by the default `gulp` command but can be run independently:

```bash
gulp watch
```

## File Structure

- `src/scss/`: Contains SCSS files that are compiled to CSS.
- `src/js/header/`: JavaScript files that are concatenated and output to `dist/js/header.js`.
- `src/js/footer/`: JavaScript files that are concatenated and output to `dist/js/footer.js`.
- `dist/css/`: Contains the compiled CSS files.
- `dist/js/`: Contains the concatenated JavaScript files.

By following these instructions, you should be able to set up and use the project without any issues. If you encounter any problems, verify that all steps have been followed correctly, or contact support.
